Versioning
----------------------------------------------

Releases will be numbered with the following format:

`<major>.<minor>.<patch>`

Versioning will not be applicable until after the software's release. After that point, it will be constructed with the following guidelines:

* Breaking backward compatibility bumps the major (and resets the minor and patch)
* New additions without breaking backward compatibility bumps the minor (and resets the patch)
* Bug fixes and misc changes bumps the patch

Code Style
----------------------------------------------

Submitted PHP code should follow accepted coding styles: [PSR-1](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-1-basic-coding-standard.md) & [PSR-2](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md).

Every Class should be in an independent file, and named in StudlyCaps: MyClass.php.
